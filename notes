npm init
npm install --save react react-dom save react-router save axios
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server babel-{core,loader} babel-preset-react

make app folder and make index.html and index.js

then we configure webpack
create webpack.config.js

inside should have

var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
var HTMLWebpackPluginConfig = new HtmlWebpackPlugin ({
  template: __dirname + '/app/index.html',
  filename: 'index.html',
  inject: 'body'
})

module.exports = {
  entry: [
    './app/index.js'
  ],
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
    filename: 'index_bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: 'babel-loader'}
    ]
  },
  plugins: [HTMLWebpackPluginConfig]
}

then make .babelrc
inside should have

{
  "presets" : ["react"]
}

go into package.json and fix script with

production: webpack -p
start: webpack-dev-server

run npm run production

from there we can now start making our file

stateless functional components are components that dont have any states or functions 
REFACTOR CODE
makes things nicer

USE PROP TYPES 
for error handling


axios.all is an array therefore being able to map over 

helpful note which is just info inside pre tag

function puke(obj) {
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(obj, 2, '')}</pre>
}


css stuff
npm install --save react-addons-css-transition-group
npm install --save-dev css-loader style-loader
*******************************************************
this is for fading in the transitions of paths
couldnt do this part because of react and react-dom versions
but this is notes for it anyways


create a new file in app called main.css
inside it put
*******************************************************

.appear-enter {
  transition-duration: .7s;
  transition-property: opacity;
  transition-timing-function: ease-out;
  opacity: 0;
}

.appear-enter.appear-enter-active {
  opacity: 1;
}

.appear-leave {
  opacity: 0;
}
*******************************************************

then go into main.js file then put
require('../main.css')

go into webpack.config.js
put this in 
module: {loaders: {
  {test: /\.css$/, loader: 'style-loader!css-loader'}
}}


var ReactCSSTransitionGroup = require('react-addons-css-transition-group')
